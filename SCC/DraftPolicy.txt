4.1 Guiding Principles
The following guiding principles, as developed and agreed upon in our AI governance workshops, will inform all AI activities:
Transparency: AI technologies should be transparent. Their purpose, capacities, and limitations should be openly communicated to relevant stakeholders.
Accountability: We should be accountable for the AI technologies we deploy and use. Clear responsibilities and accountabilities should be established and maintained throughout their lifecycle.
Privacy: AI technologies should respect and uphold privacy rights, complying with all relevant data protection legislation.
Fairness: AI technologies should be designed and used in ways that are fair and that avoid unjust biases.
Security: AI technologies should be secure and resilient, with robust safeguards to protect against misuse and threats.
Beneficence: AI technologies should be used to benefit individuals, the organisation, and society at large.
Innovation: We should promote a pro-innovation approach to the use of AI, balancing risks and benefits, and supporting the use of AI to drive improvements and advancements in our service delivery.
Human-centric: AI technologies should be designed and used in a way that respects human rights and dignity, ensures human oversight and allows for human autonomy.
Education and Awareness: We will foster a culture of continuous learning around AI and its impacts, ensuring our staff have access to training and resources to understand AI.
4.2 AI Governance
We will establish a working group responsible for overseeing AI governance within the organisation. The group will ensure that AI activities align with our guiding principles and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. They will also promote best practices, monitor AI-related risks and incidents, and foster an environment of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous learning around AI.
5. Compliance
All activities involving AI must comply with this policy, as well as all relevant laws, regulations, and standards, including but not limited to the GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and the guidelines and recommendations in the National AI Strategy, the Data Ethics Framework, and the Turing Institute's AI ethics guidelines.
6. Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed at least annually or as required to ensure it remains current with technological advancements, changes in the regulatory landscape, and evolving societal expectations.
