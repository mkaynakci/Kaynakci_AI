Summary


This evidence base informs the Vision for Surrey 2030 by presenting a picture of what life in Surrey is like and the challenges within the county. The evidence is a snapshot of data from an array of quantitative sources such as Surrey-I, governmental statistics and NOMIS. This informs the outcomes set out within the vision by identifying the key issues around the themes of ‘people’ and ‘place’ in Surrey.


People


Our population continues to grow and is predicted to age as time goes on. But the current population is largely healthy and active and comprised of a highly skilled workforce that is supported by good performing schools. Overall, educational attainment is positive however there are significant disparities for deprived children and those with additional needs. There are increasing demands on services for vulnerable adults and children, and children with additional needs. Pockets of deprivation exist across the county, and foodbank usage has risen.


Place


Housing is increasingly expensive which exacerbates the challenge to respond to the growing need for affordable housing – especially for residents on low incomes. Surrey’s economy is strong and is proving to be a popular place for businesses, which contributes to many residents’ high and increasing earnings and disposable income. However, growth appears to be stagnating in some places. Our county is well regarded as a nice place to live, with good access to green spaces and woodland. But homelessness, fuel poverty and crime are increasing, and there is dissatisfaction with the county’s road network.

The latest data shows Surrey’s population is growing rapidly, with more people living longer and consistently high birth rates. For instance, by 2030, Surrey’s population is expected to grow from an estimated 1,194,500 in 2018 to 1,264,000, and over 22% of residents will be aged 65 and over (compared to 19% in 2018).


Surrey is also becoming more ethnically diverse. According to census records, between 2001 and 2011 there was a 28.8% increase of Non-White British and Mixed/Multiple Ethnicity residents living in the county.


Highly skilled working population


Over half (50.1%) of Surrey’s working age population (16 – 64 year olds) hold a degree-level qualification. This greatly exceeds the England average of 38%. In addition, the proportion of people in Surrey holding lower-level or no qualifications continued to decrease over the last decade.

Falling employment


The employment rate has marginally decreased over time but fell particularly in the last year. However, this is not reflective of the unemployment rate which has also decreased. There has been a reduction in the amount of out-of-work benefit claimants over time, but there has been an increase particularly over the last 3 years.

Source: Department for Education (2017). Attainment 8 measures average achievement of pupils for up to eight qualifications including English, maths, three further English Baccalaureate qualifications and three further GCSE or non-GCSE qualifications. Decline in performance was expected because of change to 9 – 1 GSCE grading system.

In spite of Surrey schools’ strong educational performance, deprived pupils and those with additional needs are far less likely to do as well at school as their peers.

Despite having fewer looked after children (LAC) per 10,000 children, the number has increased from 795 to 870 (2013/14 – 16/17). This increase is a similar rate to the South East region.

Surrey residents aged (16–64) are less likely to have a long-term disability which affects day-to-day activities or the amount of work they can do, compared to the South East or England (2017/18).

There has been approximately 10,040 new dwellings built in Surrey comprised of a 23% (2240 – 2760) increase in the number of dwellings completed. However both overall and tenure figures have fluctuated over time.

Falling social accommodation waiting lists but challenges around affordable housing need remain










Social accommodation waiting lists have decreased by
24% but there has been some fluctuation.
________________


Despite decreasing at a steady rate, the number of residents claiming housing benefit living in private accommodation has remained relatively consistent with the length of social accommodation waiting lists. This may relate to the affordable housing completions as people on waiting lists often have to reside in private accommodation until a form of social housing is available.

Productivity growth has continued to increase (£28,701 - £34,070 gross value added (GVA) per head of population), remaining consistently better than the South East and England averages. However, growth in East Surrey appears to be stagnating.

Between 2005 and 2016, CO2 levels across the whole of Surrey’s road network have been falling year-on-year.
  



2005

	926.1 kt CO2
	Minor Roads
	869.9 kt CO2
	

Whilst the roads clean up, Surrey’s diesel railways have emitted more CO2 between the same time period:
41.7 kt CO2 in 2005 rose to 42.5 kt CO2 in 2016.

Over the past six years Surrey has seen both a rise and fall in the tonnage of waste disposed of by residents.




Tonnage of waste collection from kerbside bin collections has risen almost every year. Almost 41,000 additional tonnes of waste were collected in 2017/18 when compared to 2012/13.




However, waste being deposited at Community Recycling Centres (CRCs) has been declining over the same period. CRCs received nearly 34,500 fewer tonnes of waste in 2017/18 when compared to 2012/13.




The total of household waste being recycled has increased overall, but there has been some fluctuation in the last two years.

Most residents happy in their communities but do not feel able to affect local decisions




A majority of Surrey residents say they are satisfied with their neighbourhood as a place to live, believe there is a strong sense of community and people from different backgrounds get on well together.
________________




However, some residents do not influence local decisions that affect there are enough opportunities to making.
