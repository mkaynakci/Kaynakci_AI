Summary 
This evidence base informs the Vision for Surrey 2030 by presenting a picture of what life in Surrey is like and 
the challenges within the county. The evidence is a snapshot of data from an array of quantitative sources such 
as Surrey-I, governmental statistics and NOMIS. This informs the outcomes set out within the vision by 
identifying the key issues around the themes of ‘people’ and ‘place’ in Surrey. 
People 
Our population continues to grow and is predicted to age as time goes on. But the current population is largely 
healthy and active and comprised of a highly skilled workforce that is supported by good performing schools. 
Overall, educational attainment is positive however there are significant disparities for deprived children and 
those with additional needs. There are increasing demands on services for vulnerable adults and children, and 
children with additional needs. Pockets of deprivation exist across the county, and foodbank usage has risen.

Place 
Housing is increasingly expensive which exacerbates the challenge to respond to the growing need for 
affordable housing – especially for residents on low incomes. Surrey’s economy is strong and is proving to be a 
popular place for businesses, which contributes to many residents’ high and increasing earnings and disposable 
income. However, growth appears to be stagnating in some places. Our county is well regarded as a nice place 
to live, with good access to green spaces and woodland. But homelessness, fuel poverty and crime are 
increasing, and there is dissatisfaction with the county’s road network. 

Evidences
1- A growing and ageing population
The latest data shows Surrey’s population is growing rapidly, with more people living longer and consistently high birth rates. For instance, by 2030, 
Surrey’s population is expected to grow from an estimated 1,194,500 in 2018 to 1,264,000, and over 22% of residents will be aged 65 and over (compared 
to 19% in 2018). 
Surrey is also becoming more ethnically diverse. According to census records, between 2001 and 2011 there was a 28.8% increase of Non-White British 
and Mixed/Multiple Ethnicity residents living in the county.

2- Highly skilled working population Over half (50.1%) of Surrey’s working age population (16 – 64 year olds) hold a degree-level qualification. This greatly 
exceeds the England average of 38%. In addition, the proportion of people in Surrey holding lower-level or no 
qualifications continued to decrease over the last decade. 

3- Falling employment 
The employment rate has marginally decreased over time but fell particularly in the last year. However, this is 
not reflective of the unemployment rate which has also decreased. There has been a reduction in the amount 
of out-of-work benefit claimants over time, but there has been an increase particularly over the last 3 years. 

4- High performing schools but some pupils being left behind
Average Attainment 8 score declined slightly but Surrey pupils 
continue to outperform against South East and England peers. 
In spite of Surrey schools’ strong educational performance, deprived 
pupils and those with additional needs are far less likely to do as well 
at school as their peers.

5- Growing Educational Health and Care plans (EHCP) and 
Special Educational Needs (SEN) support

While remaining consistently higher than the 
South East and England, the number of pupils with 
a statement or EHCP maintained by Surrey has 
increased (5,631 – 7,710).

Contrary to regional and national trends, the 
proportion of pupils in Surrey that require SEN 
support has increased – now equivalent to the 
national percentage. This marks an increase from 
21,540 to 22,745 pupils.

6- More children in need but fewer subject to protection plans 
Despite having fewer looked after children (LAC) per 10,000 children, the number 
has increased from 795 to 870 (2013/14 – 16/17). This increase is a similar rate 
to the South East region.

In contrast to the South East and England, the number 
of children subject to a Child Protection Plan (CPP) has 
decreased (925 – 843).

Furthermore there has been considerable increase in the number of 
unaccompanied asylum seeking (UASC) children.

7- Healthy and active lives 
• The percentage of physically active adults (150+ minutes of activity per week) in Surrey is 
70.3% (2016/17). This is greater than the South East (68.9%) and England (66%) averages. 
• The percentage of physically inactive adults (less than 30 minutes of activity per week) in 
Surrey is 18.6% (2016/17). This is less than the South East (19.3%) and England averages 
(22.2%). 
Page 51
• 10.9% of Surrey’s adult population smoke (2017). The prevalence is lower than the figures for 
the South East (13.7%) and England (14.9%). 
• The number of hospital admissions for alcohol related conditions has increased: 1,520 per 
100,000 (2010/11) to 1,813 per 100,000 (2016/17). Surrey has performed consistently better 
than national trends but has fluctuated compared to South East trends.

8- Living longer 
Surrey residents tend to live long and healthy lives, exceeding the national average for both 
males and females. 

9- Fewer reported long-term disabilities but predicted increases in 
learning disabilities and mental health problems 
Surrey residents aged (16–64) are less likely to have a longterm disability which affects day-to-day activities or the 
amount of work they can do, compared to the South East 
or England (2017/18).
However, the number of working aged residents predicted 
to have learning disabilities is projected to increase by 5% 
by 2030 (17,139 – 17,916). 

The percentage of people reporting a long-term mental 
health problem (2016/17) is 4.6%. The percentage for the 
South East is 5.4% and for England is 5.7%.

• Hospital admissions for mental health conditions 
(2016/17) = 85.7 per 100,000, South East = 82 per 
100,000, England = 81.5 per 100,000. 
Source: Public Health England 
• 113,848 Surrey residents (2017) aged 18-64 are predicted 
to have a common mental disorder. This is projected to 
increase by 4%, to 118,446 (2030).

10- ‘Affluent’ Surrey has pockets of deprivation 
The 25 most deprived 
neighbourhoods in 
Surrey, according to 
the Indices of 
Multiple Deprivation 
(2015), are also 
within the third most 
deprived areas in the 
county. 
58 neighbourhoods 
across Surrey rank 
among the worst 
third of areas in the 
country for children 
aged under the age of 
16 that live low 
income households

11- Rising foodbank usage 
The number of three-day emergency food supplies 
distributed by Trussell Trust foodbanks in Surrey has more 
than doubled. The increase well exceeds Surrey’s South 
East neighbours. Latest figures also show that 2 in 5 
emergency food supplies are for children. 

12- A socially mobile county 
The Social Mobility Commission’s 
‘State of the nation’ report suggests 
that residents in Surrey have positive 
social mobility outcomes– meaning, 
residents from a poor background 
have good prospects for moving up a 
social hierarchy. 
Page 56
Surrey’s local authorities had a 
combined average ranking of 53rd of 
324 (1st being the highest). 
Epsom & Ewell, Elmbridge and 
Surrey Heath are ranked in the top 
10% of local authorities in the 
country. Woking, Reigate & 
Banstead, Mole Valley, Tandridge 
and Runnymede ranked in the top 
20%

13- Expensive housing 
The median house price in Surrey is £430,000 following 
a 35% increase over the last 4 years. This increase 
exceeds both the rate in England and the South East 
(24% and 34% respectively). 

The gap between median earnings and house price has 
increased by 37% (9 to 11.9) and continues to exceed both 
the England and South East average.

14- Projected increase in housing constructions but constraints on 
the infrastructure to support it 
There has been approximately 10,040 new dwellings built in 
Surrey comprised of a 23% (2240 – 2760) increase in the 
number of dwellings completed. However both overall and 
tenure figures have fluctuated over time.

Between 2015 – 2030 Surrey authorities planned to 
deliver on average 3,137 dwellings per year. This 
comes to a total of 47,053 dwellings to 2030. 
• Delivering the infrastructure to support growth was 
identified to cost at least £5.37 billion to 2030. 
However when considering the amount of potential 
funding, there is a projected minimum gap in 
infrastructure funding of £3.2 billion between 2015 to 
2030. 

15- Falling social accommodation waiting lists but challenges around 
affordable housing need remain 
Page 59
Social accommodation waiting lists have decreased by 
24% but there has been some fluctuation. 

Despite decreasing at a steady rate, the number of residents claiming housing 
benefit living in private accommodation has remained relatively consistent with 
the length of social accommodation waiting lists. This may relate to the 
affordable housing completions as people on waiting lists often have to reside in 
private accommodation until a form of social housing is available

16- Increasing homelessness 
The number of residents in temporary accommodation has increased by 33% and the overall reduction 
in preventions may suggest there is a challenge in responding to the increase. 

17- Increasing fuel poverty 
Although the rate in Surrey has remained lower than the South East and England average, 
the proportion of fuel poor households has increased. This marks an increase from an 
estimated 34,424 to 39,022 households. 

18- A strong economy but divergence between the East and West 
Productivity growth has continued to increase (£28,701 - £34,070 gross value added (GVA) 
per head of population), remaining consistently better than the South East and England 
averages. However, growth in East Surrey appears to be stagnating.

19- High and increasing earnings 
Residents’ median weekly earnings have continued to increase. This is reflected in Surrey’s 
high disposable household income (£27,865 per head per year) which has increased at a 
greater rate than the South East and England.

20- An attractive place for businesses 
The number of active enterprise per 10,000 population has remained considerably higher 
than the South East and England, with business births exceeding business deaths each year

21- A mixed workforce from inside and outside of the county 
57.5% of our residents work in Surrey and almost a quarter are working in a London borough. Of the people 
that work in Surrey, around 16% live in a London borough and 24% live elsewhere.

22- Rising crime and growing resident concerns
14% Increase in the number of crimes recorded in Surrey –
second highest rate of increase in the South East between 
March 2017 and March 2018. 
Residents’ concerns with the levels of crime appear to be growing, 
particularly with crimes such as burglary, drug dealing and vandalism. 
Concern with physical attacks and violence has not increased despite 
an increase in the number of violent crimes recorded. 

The number of recorded crimes has increased across Surrey and 
the South East. Surrey has seen a greater than regional average 
increase in recorded burglary, criminal damage and drug offences, 
and significant increases in robbery and violent crime.

23- Anti-social behaviour (ASB) has fallen over the last decade
While other types of crime have been increasing, the rate of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in Surrey has decreased, 
reflecting national and regional trends. The number of incidents fell from over 64,000 in 2007/8 to just over 25,000 in 2017/18


24- Domestic abuse is a growing problem 
In the year ending 31 March 2016, there were nearly 14,500 incidents of domestic abuse recorded by Surrey Police – an 
increase of 4.5% on the previous year. Reported incidents of domestic abuse are significantly more prevalent in Reigate 
and Banstead and Spelthorne. Over 45% of incidents involved children in some way.

While the number of domestic abuse incidents has gone up, 
the rate of offences per 1,000 people remains lower than 
the South East and England

25- Residents rely on highways and railways to get to work
Figures from the 2011 census show that 
Surrey’s residents rely more heavily on the 
local rail network than the national or 
regional average, with 13.5% of working 
adults taking the train to work. 
Use of urban rail, buses or taxis are all 
below the national average. 
By comparison, 62.6% of residents drive or 
are passengers within a car or van for their 
daily commute – this being above the 
national average. 
2.2% of residents use a bicycle for their 
commute, and 8.6% travel on foot.

26- Surrey’s road network is amongst the busiest in the country 
The average number of the number of vehicles passing a 
point in the road network each day in Surrey is significantly 
higher than the South East average, and almost double the 
national average of traffic. 

Throughout this decade, the volume of traffic on Surrey 
roads has increased significantly. There were 431 million 
more vehicle miles travelled on Surrey’s roads in 2017 
compared with 2010.

27- Greener roads
Between 2005 and 2016, CO2 levels across the whole of Surrey’s 
road network have been falling year-on-year. 
Whilst the roads clean up, Surrey’s diesel railways have emitted
more CO2 between the same time period: 
41.7 kt CO2 in 2005 rose to 42.5 kt CO2 in 2016.

28- Residents have mixed feelings towards Surrey’s roads
Recent results from the annual Surrey 
Residents’ Survey show that 28.6% of 
respondents were satisfied with road 
maintenance. 63.9% of respondents , 
however, were dissatisfied.

43% of respondents were satisfied 
with road congestion management, 
opposed to 41.5% that were 
dissatisfied. 

Finally, on vehicle parking 49.4% of 
respondents were satisfied with 
vehicle parking in the county, though 
39.5% were dissatisfied with this

29- More waste disposed through bins, less in Community Recycling Centres
Over the past six years Surrey has seen both a rise and fall 
in the tonnage of waste disposed of by residents. 
Tonnage of waste collection from kerbside bin collections 
has risen almost every year. Almost 41,000 additional 
tonnes of waste were collected in 2017/18 when compared 
to 2012/13. 
However, waste being deposited at Community Recycling 
Centres (CRCs) has been declining over the same period. 
CRCs received nearly 34,500 fewer tonnes of waste in 
2017/18 when compared to 2012/13. 
The total of household waste being recycled has increased 
overall, but there has been some fluctuation in the last two 
years.

30- Most residents happy in their communities but do not feel able to 
affect local decisions 
A majority of Surrey residents say they are satisfied with 
their neighbourhood as a place to live, believe there is a 
strong sense of community and people from different 
backgrounds get on well together.

However, some residents do not feel they are able to 
influence local decisions that affect them, nor do they think 
there are enough opportunities to influence local decision 
making.

31- Residents have good access to woodland spaces
In Surrey 
25.3% of 
people live 
within 500 
metres of 
accessible 
woodland area

By comparison, 
in England 
16.8% live 
within 500 
metres of 
accessible 
woodland area

78.9% of residents are satisfied with maintenance of Surrey’s countryside
